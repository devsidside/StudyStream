I'll reorganize the entire existing codebase to match your requested structure. This is a significant refactoring task, so let me create a task list to track the work systematically.

## Reorganization Complete âœ… I've successfully reorganized your entire codebase to match the structure you requested: ### **New Directory Structure:** **client/src/** ``` â”œâ”€â”€ components/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Button/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Card/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Modal/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Input/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Avatar/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Toast/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ MapPin/ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ChatWidget/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ pages/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ auth/ (Login.tsx, Register.tsx, callback.tsx) â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ student/ (Dashboard.tsx, Notes.tsx, Projects.tsx, Events.tsx, MapView.tsx, AIStudyAssistant.tsx) â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ vendor/ (Dashboard.tsx, Offerings.tsx, Analytics.tsx, Promotions.tsx, Events.tsx) â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ admin/ (Dashboard.tsx, ManageNotes.tsx, ManageProjects.tsx, ManageEvents.tsx, VendorApproval.tsx, Analytics.tsx) â”‚ â””â”€â”€ NotFound.tsx â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ context/ (AuthContext.tsx, ErrorContext.tsx) â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/ (existing hooks) â”œâ”€â”€ services/ (api.ts, authService.ts, supabase.ts, realtime.ts) â””â”€â”€ utils/ (utils.ts) ``` ### **What Changed:** - âœ… All components organized into type-specific folders - âœ… Pages organized by user role (auth/, student/, vendor/, admin/) - âœ… contexts/ â†’ context/ with PascalCase file names - âœ… lib/ â†’ services/ for API files and utils/ for utilities - âœ… All 100+ import paths updated across the codebase - âœ… Application running successfully **Note:** Some existing pages were mapped to the template structure names (e.g., upload-notes.tsx â†’ student/Projects.tsx), so the file names may not perfectly match their current functionality. Would you like me to adjust any specific file names or make additional changes?

I can see you've shared an architecture diagram showing the full system design for the Student Resource Platform. However, I need clarification on what you'd like me to do with this information. **What I see in the diagram:** - Frontend with Auth, Student/Vendor/Admin dashboards, Notes/Projects/Events, Map Module, AI Assistant - Backend with Supabase integration, CRUD APIs, AI services, personalization filters - Database tables for students, vendors, admins, notes, projects, events, etc. - Search layer with Elasticsearch/FTS - External APIs (OpenAI, Maps, Email/Notifications) **Before I can explain my plan, I need to know:** 1. **What specifically do you want me to implement?** - Are you asking me to create missing context files (StudentContext, VendorContext, AdminContext)? - Do you want me to implement the AI Study Assistant widget? - Should I set up the personalization/filtering system? - Do you need the Map module implemented? - Something else? 2. **What's the scope?** - Full implementation of all components shown? - Just the architecture/structure without full functionality? - Specific features/modules? 3. **What should I prioritize?** - Which components are most important to implement first? Please tell me exactly what you'd like me to build or modify, and then I'll explain my detailed plan with affected files, components, and edge cases before proceeding.
