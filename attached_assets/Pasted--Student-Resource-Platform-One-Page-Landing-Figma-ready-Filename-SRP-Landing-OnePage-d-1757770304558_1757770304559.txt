## 5. Interaction & Motion Spec

* **Hero onLoad:** Fade up elements (stagger 80ms) — H1 → subhead → CTAs → avatars.
* **Illustration:** Gentle float (translateY) animation, GPU accelerated (transform only).
* **Cards onScroll:** IntersectionObserver triggers slide + fade (translateY 16px → 0, opacity 0→1).
* **Mockup area:** Vertical auto-scroll inside device frame (looped). Pause on hover and when prefers-reduced-motion.
* **Counters:** animate from 0 to value when in viewport (duration 900–1400ms, easing easeOutCubic).
* **Nav onScroll:** Transparent to solid background transition after 60px; add subtle blur + shadow.
* **Button interactions:** scale(0.98) on active; visible focus ring (2px outline using `--primary`).

Performance rules: keep animations in `transform` + `opacity`. No layout-triggering animations.

## 6. Accessibility Notes

* Color contrast: verify H1 gradient overlay has a solid fallback for readability; ensure 4.5:1 for body text.
* Focus states: all interactive controls have visible focus ring and focus order is logical.
* Keyboard: hamburger and carousels keyboard operable; ARIA labels for important regions.
* Motion: support `prefers-reduced-motion`; provide non-animated variants.
* Images: all meaningful images have `alt`; decorative images `aria-hidden=true`.

---

## 7. Assets & Export Guidelines

* Icons: export SVGs (single path, optimized) — stroke 1.5px for small icons, 2px for hero symbols.
* Illustrations: export as multi-layer SVG with fallback PNG/WebP at 2× sizes.
* Mockup screens: export WebP responsive images: 360w, 720w, 1200w.
* Avatars: export 48px, 96px PNG/WebP with circle masks.
* All assets named using kebab-case with folder structure: `/assets/icons/`, `/assets/illust/`, `/assets/screens/`.

---

## 8. Handoff & Developer Notes

* Provide a token JSON for developers (colors, fonts, spacing). Example `tokens.json` in the file.
* Provide component props table (button sizes, CTA variants, card props).
* Provide sample HTML structure snippets in a separate code tab (Next.js + Tailwind ready): hero, card grid, feature block.
* Provide accessibility checklist and testing notes for QA.
* Include redlines and spacing specs for every breakpoint.

---

## 9. Prototype & Testing Recommendations

* Create an interactive Figma prototype with anchored nav links and transitions.
* Conduct A/B tests on hero copy and primary CTA color (primary vs cta‑grad).
* Run user testing (5–8 students & 2–4 vendors) on prototype to validate comprehension and CTA clarity.

## 10. Deliverables bundled in this Figma file

1. Desktop, tablet, mobile artboards (full page).
2. Component library (Buttons, Cards, Navbar, Footer, Forms, Carousels).
3. Tokens page (colors, type, spacing).
4. Interaction specs & prototype.
5. Export-ready assets (icons, illustrations, mockups).
6. Handoff notes + `tokens.json` + sample Tailwind token map.

---

If you'd like, I can now:

* Export a ready Tailwind + React component file set for the landing page (JSX + Tailwind classes), or
* Generate the `tokens.json` and a Storybook-ready component playground, or
* Produce a lightweight clickable HTML prototype you can host immediately.

Which of the above would you like me to create next?
